# Sandbox: Falling Sand Simulation in Kotlin Compose for Desktop

This project demonstrates a simple falling sands simulation built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Desktop.

Features:

* Sand particles fall under gravity.
* Particles interact with each other and the bottom boundary, creating a dynamic simulation.
* Colours!

## Contributing

The code for this project is decent, but not great. There is a ton of performance optimisation that can be done, if you
feel so inclined. I haven't really bothered too much. It's plenty fast on my Macbook.

We welcome contributions to this project. Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
